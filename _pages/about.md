Welcome to my personal website! I'm **Yiting Zheng**, currently pursuing a Master of Information Technology degree (Research Pathway) at Monash University, focusing on dialogue-based learning, computational analysis, and machine learning research.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of multiple disciplines:

- **Dialogue-Based Learning Analysis**: Studying cognitive processes and socio-emotional dynamics in medical training dialogues
- **Natural Language Processing**: Transforming qualitative research insights into quantifiable computational metrics
- **Machine Learning**: Developing predictive models such as XGBoost for dialogue usefulness analysis
- **Educational Technology**: Advancing interdisciplinary research in medical education through computational analysis

## Current Research

I am currently working on **"Exploring Learning Performance through Knowledge and Interaction Analysis in Medical Training Dialogues"** (in preparation), supervised by **Guanliang Chen** at Monash University.

### Research Focus Areas:
1. **Dynamic Analysis**: Systematic integration and analysis of the interplay between cognitive processes and socio-emotional dynamics in medical training dialogues
2. **Computational Transformation**: Converting qualitative research insights (e.g., "pathophysiological reasoning") into quantifiable indicators through detailed coding schemes and multi-level computational analysis

### Core Research Methods:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA)
- Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM)
- Process Modelling and Cluster Analysis
- Sequence Analysis/Process Mining

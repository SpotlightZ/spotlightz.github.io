Welcome to my personal website! I'm **Yiting Zheng**, currently pursuing a Master of Information Technology degree (Research Pathway) at Monash University, focusing on dialogue-based learning, computational analysis, and machine learning research.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of multiple disciplines:

- **Dialogue-Based Learning Analysis**: Studying cognitive processes and socio-emotional dynamics in medical training dialogues
- **Natural Language Processing**: Transforming qualitative research insights into quantifiable computational metrics
- **Machine Learning**: Developing predictive models such as XGBoost for dialogue usefulness analysis
- **Time Series Analysis**: Public health trend prediction and resource optimization

## Current Research

I am currently working on a research project focused on **Knowledge and Interaction Analysis in Medical Training Dialogues**, which aims to:

1. Systematically integrate and analyze the dynamic interplay between cognitive processes and socio-emotional dynamics in medical training dialogues
2. Transform qualitative research insights such as "pathophysiological reasoning" into quantifiable indicators that can be processed by NLP through detailed coding schemes and multi-level computational analysis

## Technical Background

I have a solid technical foundation including:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost, Random Forest, SHAP, ARIMA
- **Analytics Tools**: Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA), Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM)
- **Cloud Computing**: AWS, Serverless Architecture, RESTful APIs

## Professional Experience

Prior to my academic research, I worked as a Full-Stack Development Engineer at Beijing Corefire Technology Co., responsible for multi-platform application development with extensive practical project experience.

I am currently seeking PhD opportunities to further explore how computational methods can enhance our understanding of learning processes.

Welcome! I'm **Yiting Zheng**, a passionate researcher and PhD applicant currently pursuing a Master of Information Technology (Research Pathway) at Monash University. My work sits at the exciting intersection of **dialogue-based learning analysis**, **computational linguistics**, and **machine learning**.

## Research Vision

I'm dedicated to transforming how we understand learning processes through computational methods. My research focuses on analyzing cognitive and socio-emotional dynamics in medical training dialogues, bridging the gap between qualitative educational insights and quantitative analytical frameworks.

## Current Focus

Working under the supervision of **Dr. Guanliang Chen**, I'm developing innovative approaches to:
- Extract meaningful patterns from educational dialogue data using NLP and machine learning
- Create computational models that can predict and enhance learning outcomes
- Apply advanced analytics (ENA, Sequential Pattern Mining) to understand complex learning processes

## Key Achievements

- **Research Impact**: Developed XGBoost models achieving **20.79% RMSE improvement** in dialogue usefulness prediction
- **Technical Innovation**: Built scalable AWS serverless platforms for intelligent media analysis
- **Academic Excellence**: Maintaining **82/100 WAM** (3.5/4.0 GPA) in research-focused master's program

## Looking Forward

I'm actively seeking **PhD opportunities** to expand my research on computational approaches to educational technology. My goal is to develop AI-driven tools that can revolutionize how we understand and optimize learning processes in professional training environments.

## Significant Research Progress

I am pleased to announce that we have made significant progress in our research on medical training dialogue analysis.

### Key Achievements

- **FLoRA Dialogue Analysis Project**: Successfully developed a dialogue usefulness prediction model based on XGBoost, achieving a 20.79% improvement in RMSE and a 22% improvement in MAE compared to the baseline model
- **Hospital Trend Prediction Research**: Constructed a time series prediction model that reached a MAPE of 0.98%, providing data support for healthcare resource optimization
- **BirdTag Platform**: Completed the development of a serverless media analysis platform on AWS, implementing AI-driven automatic media tagging functionality

### Research Method Innovation

During the research process, we paid particular attention to transforming qualitative research insights into computable quantitative indicators, which is significant for advancing interdisciplinary research in educational technology and medical education.

### Next Steps

We are currently preparing to organize some of the research findings into academic papers, and continue to explore applications of Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) and Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM) in medical education.
